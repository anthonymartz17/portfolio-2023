## Design Challenges and Solutions

As a non-designer, I faced the challenge of creating an appealing design for the website. To overcome this, I delved into the fundamentals of web design, including visual hierarchy, alignment, proximity, balance, repetition, and typography. Resources like YouTube, freeCodeCamp, and typescale.com proved invaluable in gaining a better understanding of these concepts. The result is a professional and visually pleasing appearance that enhances user experience.

## Custom Icons Implementation

I particularly enjoyed implementing custom icons on the website. Unsatisfied with the limited options in common icon libraries, I drew inspiration from Font Awesome's icon components functionality and developed a custom component. This component houses all the SVG icons, allowing for easy customization through props. Thanks to the Canva platform, I found cooler and more creative icons, making the experience both enjoyable and rewarding.
